    "# 2 Solving the RFA problem using FEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with the FEniCS code, we will present a short theoretical introduction. The simulation of RFA in atrial wall involves two main physical coupled problems modeled by the electric equation and the bioheat equation, we briefly introduce both. The thermal damage is evaluated by considering the Arrhenius equation which is commented aswell. The structure of this section of the tutorial is as follows: first the theory, then the strategy of the numerical solution, and finally, the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 The electric equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In RFA the heat ($q_{RF}$) is generated by Joule effect, applying an electric current to the desired region. This heat depends on the electric conductivity ($\\sigma$) and the electric field ($E$), and is given by the equation $q_{\\text{RF}}=\\sigma \\left| E\\right|^{2}$. The electric field is defined as $E=-\\nabla V$, where $V$ is the voltage. The latter is computed by solving the called Poisson equation in the desired volume (domain) $\\Omega$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation} \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\sigma \\nabla V \\right) = 0.\\end{equation}\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric conductivity can be a function of the position and the temperature. The Eq. (1) is a __*partial differential equation*__ (PDE) and can be solved if the __*boundary conditions*__ are known, in our case (remember the section of mesh generation) we have set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $V = 50$ V in the tagged with 2 (*Physical Line(2) = {1,2,4}; // active electrode (metal)*).\n",
    "- $V = 0$ V in the tagged with 3 (*Physical Line(3) = {11,12}; // passive electrode, V = 0*).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are Dirichlet boundary conditions. The domains of the boundary conditions will be called $\\Gamma$, in particular for a Dirichlet boundary condition $\\Gamma_{\\text{D}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 The bioheat equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature $T$ is obtained by solving the governing PDE for the thermal problem, which is the bioheat equation modified by the enthalpy method to take the vaporization phenomenon into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial \\rho h}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( k \\nabla T\\right) +q_{\\text{RF}} +\\beta \\rho_{\\text{b}}c_{\\text{b}}\\omega_{\\text{b}}\\left(T_{\\text{b}}-T\\right)+Q_{\\text{met}}\\end{equation}\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat, $\\omega$ is the perfusion, and we set the $Q_{\\text{met}}=0$ (metabolic heat) because it is negligible in RFA. The parameter $\\beta$ is a coefficient which took the values of 0 and 1, according to the value of the thermal damage (we will explain it latter). The mentioned parameters can be functions of the position and temperature. The subscript b indicates that they are parameters of blood. Regarding the enthalpy term, the dependence with temperature is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\\frac{\\partial \\rho h}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\cdot \\begin{array}{l} \\rho_{\\text{l}} c_{\\text{l}} \\; \\text{ if } \\; T < 99 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C }\\\\h_{\\text{fg}}C \\; \\text{  if } \\; 99 \\leq T \\leq 100  ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C }\\\\ \\rho_{\\text{g}}c_{\\text{g}} \\; \\text{ if } \\; T > 100  ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C }\\end{array} \\end{equation} \\tag{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The subscript l, and g refer to liquid state, and to gaseous state, respectively. $h_{\\text{fg}}$ is the product of water latent heat of vaporization and water density at 100 $^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$, and $C$ is water content inside the tissue (68%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The __*boundary conditions*__ of Eq. (2) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $T = 37 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$ in the tagged with 3 and 4 (*Physical Line(3) = {11,12}; // passive electrode, U = 0 V and 37 deg* and *Physical Line(4) = {8,17,18}; // I = 0 A and 37 deg*).\n",
    "- $T = 40 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$ in the tagged with 5 (*Physical Line(5) = {3}; // perfusion constant temperature 40 deg*). This simulates a irrigated electrode, perfused with saline solution at $40 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions are also Dirichlet. The thermal effect of the circulating blood in the cardiac chamber (assuming high flow) can be modeled using thermal transfer coefficients between blood and the tissue ($h_{\\text{t}} = 610 \\; \\text{W}/\\text{m}^{2} \\text{K}$) and between blood and the electrode ($h_{\\text{e}} = 3346 \\; \\text{W}/\\text{m}^{2} \\text{K}$). They are known as Robin boundary condition and are expressed as: $-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}=h_{\\text{i}}\\left( T - T_{\\text{b}}\\right)$, for $\\text{i}=\\text{t},\\text{e}$ where $n$ is the unit vector which points the normal direction of the boundary (line in 2D or surface in 3D). We set such a condition to the lines tagged with 6 and 7, respectively (*Physical Line(6) = {16}; // convective heat loss (plastic)\n",
    "Physical Line(7) = {7}; // convective heat loss (tissue)*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Robin and Neumman boundary conditions we will call them $\\Gamma_{\\text{R}}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\text{N}}$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a transient heat equation, therefore __*initial condition*__ is also needed:\n",
    "$$T\\left(x,y, t = 0 \\; \\text{s}\\right) = 37 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C},$$\n",
    "we make implicit here the dependence on position and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 The thermal damage\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arrhenius damage model associates temperature with exposure time using a first‐order kinetics relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation} D\\left(t\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} Ae^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{RT}} d\\tau \\end{equation} \\tag{4},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $\\Delta E$ are a frequency factor and the activation\n",
    "energy for the irreversible damage reaction, respectively. $R$ is the universal gas constant. We assessed the thermal damage by the D99 isoline, which corresponds to $D= 4.6$ (99% probability of cell death). This means that when the value of $D=4.6$ we change the value of $\\beta$ to zero, then the blood perfusion term of the bioheat equation is nulled. The location of the D99 isoline defined the size of the coagulation zone.\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial we express the Eq. (4) as an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n",
    "$$\\frac{dD}{dt}=Ae^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{RT\\left(t\\right)}}\\tag{5}.$$\n",
    "Note that we explicit the dependence on time of the temperature ($T\\left(t\\right)$), in order to show that it results in a non-linear ODE that should be numerically solved at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4 The variational form\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for the finite element methods is to express the PDE in *variational form* in order to solve the weak problem. For example, if we work with Eq. (1) (a little bit modified to generalize the reasoning, that is, $-\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\sigma \\nabla V \\right) = f$, where $f$ is a known source), first we have to multiply the PDE by a function $v$ (__*test function*__) and integrate the resulting equation over the domain $\\Omega$. \n",
    "$$-\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\sigma \\nabla V \\right) = f \\Rightarrow -\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\sigma \\nabla V \\right)\\; v\\; \\text{dx} = \\int_{\\Omega} f \\; v \\; \\text{dx}.$$\n",
    "We denote here $\\text{dx}$ as the differential of the domain $\\Omega$, in this example: $\\text{dx}=dxdy$. Note that the left part of Eq. (1) has second-order derivatives, solving PDEs with FEM requires integration by parts in order to obtain first-order derivatives only. This is obtained by applying the Green’s Formula.\n",
    "$$-\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\sigma \\nabla V \\right)\\; v\\; \\text{dx} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma\\nabla V \\cdot \\nabla v \\;\\text{dx} - \\int_{\\Gamma} \\sigma \\; n\\cdot \\nabla V \\;v \\;\\text{ds}.\\tag{6}$$\n",
    "The term $n\\cdot\\nabla V$ is the derivative of $V$ in the outward normal direction $n$ on the  respective boundary, and it is denoted as $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n}$. The differential $\\text{ds}$ is defined on the boundary domain $\\Gamma$. Reordering the Eq. (6):\n",
    "$$\\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma \\nabla  V \\cdot \\nabla v \\;\\text{dx} = \\int_{\\Omega} f \\; v \\; \\text{dx}-\\int_{\\Gamma} \\sigma \\; \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n} \\;v \\;\\text{ds}.\\tag{7}$$\n",
    "In our electrical problem there are only Dirichlet boundary conditions and $v$ can be chosen in order to vanish on the boundaries, therefore the second term of the right hand of Eq. (7) also vanishes: \n",
    "$$\\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma \\nabla  V \\cdot \\nabla v \\;\\text{dx} = \\int_{\\Omega} f \\; v \\; \\text{dx}.\\tag{8}$$\n",
    "The left hand of this equation is called the __*bilinear form*__ and the right hand the __*linear form*__, and usually are denoted by: $a\\left(V,v\\right)$ and $L\\left(v\\right)$, respectively. Note that $a$ is function of both $V$ and $v$, and $L$ is only function of $v$ (because $f$ is the known source).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the bioheat equation the procedure is similar, with the addition of the Robin boundary conditions (convective). They are modeled as $-k\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}=h\\left( T - T_{\\text{b}}\\right)$, such a condition is then written as:\n",

    "## 2.2 Numerical strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be remarked that we have to solve three coupled equations: two PDEs and one ODE. We need to discretize them in space and time. In this section we comment the time discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 General approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Eq. (1) is an electric quasi‐static approach, which is used since the resistive current is much lower than the displacement current at RF. Equation (1) is only related to the Eq. (2) by the dependence on $T$ of the electric conductivity ($\\sigma \\left(T\\right)$). Therefore, one approach is to solve Eq. (1) with a known temperature by considering the electric conductivity constant at this particular temperature. That is, picewise constant within the time step, starting from the body temperature ($37 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$). In this way the voltage is uncoupled from the temperature, it is considered a weak coupling. Therefore the general approach can be outlined by the next __*steps*__:\n",
    "1. Initialize temperature of the geometry.\n",
    "2. With known temperatures solve Eq. (1) to obtain $q_{\\text{RF}}$.\n",
    "3. With known $q_{\\text{RF}}$ solve Eq. (2).\n",
    "4. With known temperature integrate the Eq. (4).\n",
    "5. Go to step 2 and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Scheme of the time discretisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (2) depends on time, it can be solved by a simple backward Euler approach. The first derivative is approached by:\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\right)^{\\left(n+1\\right)}\\approx \\frac{T^{\\left(n+1\\right)}-T^{\\left(n\\right)}}{\\Delta t} \\end{equation},\\tag{8}$$\n",
    "where the superscript $\\left(n\\right)$ indicates the time step $n$. The first step is known, because we have the initial condition $T\\left(x,y, t = 0 \\; \\text{s}\\right) = 37 ^{\\text{ o}}\\text{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 Dependence of temperature of the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity in the example of this tutorial, we consider *two parameters* which depend on temperature: the electric conductivity and the enthalpy. The latter is modeled with the Eq. (3), and we model the conductivity with a linear dependence on temperature.
